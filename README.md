# Integrated Municipality Management System for Barangay Talamban
This is a school project in Software Engineering class. It is a management system for barangay Talamban, Cebu. Currently, it only catered the health center management part. Feel free to fork this project if you wish to explore on Yii PHP framework or if you wish to continue this project and propose it to the barangay (LOL).

Steps to get this working:

1. Add a new folder named "assets" in the root directory.
2. Add a new folder named "runtime" inside "protected" folder.
3. Edit the MySQL username and password in protected/config/main.php (find "//change this")
4. Import immsdb.sql to your local MySQL database.
5. Run the application using your favorite web server (i.e. Apache)
6. Enter "admin123" as username and "password" as password.
7. Explore :D
